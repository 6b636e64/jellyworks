For this project I contributed in several ways to both user authentication and form interactions as well as polishing a few aspects from project 2. For the second project we were struggling to connect our Services model with the Reviews model, so I figured out how to make Service a foreign key for Reviews. This ended up being super useful for making CustomUser also a foreign key for reviews to satisfy the second requirement under "User Interaction with Forms." 

Probably my biggest contribution to this project was connecting django's built-in User model to our own CustomUser model, which I had to make a new application for. This provided it's own complications, since whenever refering to the model I had to make sure I was referring to the correct file--I frequently would reference it and django would give me an error about the CustomUser model not being found.

One of the most challenging aspects of this project was working with forms. We spent many hours (like, so many hours) debugging what ended up being no more than 5 lines of code in our views.py file. It was extremely difficult to find our exact error since our Service model was a foreign key for our Reviews model since it is a one-to-many relationship. Overall I feel like we made a lot of good progress with our web application and I can't wait to see how the final product turns out!
