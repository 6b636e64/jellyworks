## Overview
Our app aims to match “buyers” to “sellers”. Each seller will have the opportunity to offer services like a haircut or a physical product such as a bike. We’ve limited our potential users—buyers and sellers—to students from UMass. When buyers select a seller to patronize, they “match” with that person i.e. they find their Sidehustle Match. The application is inspired by Etsy and Amazon. We are merging salient components of each e.g. the amature marketplace fostered by Etsy and the intuitive and accessible UI of Amazon, to create something unique that focuses on college students.
