For this project I am sad to say I did very little to help out. I mismanaged my time and ran into unforeseen family issues and failed to make any meaningful contribution to this particular assignment.

The only things I actually changed were the the asthetics of the Browse page such as changing the button to say "Match!" as well as adjusting the Services model and view to match our old description of public profile, and simplify public profile to just a few characteristics.

I feel I deserve a poor grade on this assignment due to the stress I may have caused my teammates and my lack of contribution to the assignment, and I hope to make it up to my teammates with my effort in the next assignment.
