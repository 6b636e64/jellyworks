# Jellyworks Team Submission
## Overview
Our app aims to match “buyers” to “sellers”. Each seller will have the opportunity to offer services like a haircut or a physical product such as a bike. We’ve limited our potential users—buyers and sellers—to students from UMass. When buyers select a seller to patronize, they “match” with that person i.e. they find their Sidehustle Match. The application is inspired by Etsy and Amazon. We are merging salient components of each e.g. the amature marketplace fostered by Etsy and the intuitive and accessible UI of Amazon, to create something unique that focuses on college students.

## Problems/Successes
Our team as a whole works quite well together when we can meet. Since we are a group of 5, it is hard for our group to be able to meet all at once. In order to compensate for that, we met up in smaller groups and kept everyone else up-to-date in the Slack. It was extremely helpful to have in-class time to work on the project as all of the members of our group could be together. In order to complete the next section of the project on time, we are going to improve more upon our communication in Slack and compare schedules earlier on in the process. We are also going to try and spread out our working sessions more in order to avoid late nights close to the deadline. 

One of our biggest issues was working with Github. We had many issues with merging branches and the command line. We were able to solve this issue by meeting up in person and working through the problem in order to ensure that it didn’t happen again. Once we met, we had very few commit issues. 

Another issue that we had during this project was connecting all of our faker data across all of the pages. Since we each worked on one specific page, connecting those pages (especially if they shared data) was a challenge that we should have anticipated earlier on in the process. In the future, we need to pay more attention to overlap earlier on in the process in order to avoid scrambling. 

As far as implementing our application, our team exhibited a synergy that exceeded everyone’s expectations. Each of us focused on working on our own pages. As a result, it was easy to focus because we each knew exactly what we had to tackle. Towards the end of the project, some of us managed to finish their pages before others. Subsequently, whenever one of us encountered an issue, they were able to help others get past their issues.
