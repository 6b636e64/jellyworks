I did part 1 of this project. I implemented authentication, authorization, and session support. I changed the appropriate files to reflect different data depending on which user is logged in. 

I also got “Change Password” link to work by using the appropriate view and form. I made it so that after a successful password change, the user would be redirected back to the profile screen and also does not have to log back in. I did the same for “Edit Personal Information”; it redirects back to profile page if the action is successful.

I worked with my team to get our product view with form at the bottom to work. It was having an issue with saving into the database until we made a breakthrough. I realized that our data wasn’t saving into the database because it was not saving to the right attribute. I also introduced my teammates to git branches and walked them through the process so nobody would push buggy code to the master branch.
