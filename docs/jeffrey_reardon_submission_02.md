# Jeffrey Reardon

For this project my primary contribution was the implementation of the “filtersearch” or “browse” page of our website. In order to do this, I needed to map my html file to the button on our header bar in urls.py, as well as create the corresponding views and models for the page. This entailed me creating fields in the publicProfile and services models and establishing the appropriate context for the filtersearch page in views.


I also worked on populating the database with faker in accordance to these fields in publicProfile and services. The filtersearch page at the moment can take the fake data that is created in init.py, and displays cards with this data that at a future point, will be able to be filtered with the check boxes in the side bar. I attempted to complete the filter function while working on project 2, but was unable to clean out the last few bugs and decided to keep it out of our current submission.


I also contributed to random problems we had while debugging during our multiple team meetings that took place. In regards to this, I would say I was much more helpful during the 2nd half of the project, as it took me a while through part 1 to get acclimated to what we were doing, so most of my contributions to part 1 actually occurred while backtracking from part 2. With this being the case, most of my major debugging contributions involved manipulating our fake data, and making sure our html pages all properly connected with our views and models.
