### Sarah Manlove - Individual Write Up

I contributed to several aspects of this project. First, I created the data model diagram in Google Slides, which I edited whenever we made changes to models.py. Along with the rest of my group, I worked on models.py and init.py. I specifically focused on the publicProfile section. 

In addition to the diagram, I designed and implemented the code for the product page UI. Using my work from the UI Mockup, I created the product.html template and made sure to implement the CSS in way that the final view looked like the mockup. I also started working on the views.py/init.py files to create the fake data. 

Finally, I worked on many of the organizational and administrative tasks connected to the project. For instance, I was the member of the group that reserved all of the group study rooms for our working sessions and made to-do lists in Slack or on the whiteboard. I also co-wrote the team writeup with Edwood. 

Overall, this project was a big learning experience for me as I was getting used to using the command line and git. Additionally, Django and python was a challenge to learn, but I made sure that I did my part and I attempted to help other people in my group as much as I was able. We worked well as a group, and we learned quite a bit from each other as well.
