  For this project I created the skeleton website and created the github repository for part 0. I helped write models.py and init.py along with the rest of my group to populate our database with fake data, and then spent a good hour (at least) debugging with the rest of my group (it was a rough time). Part of the reason we spent so much time debugging was definitely because we did not heed the advice given in the project documentation to do things step by step and confirm they were working, but luckily we did eventually figure it out (mostly) by ourselves. 
  
  For templates I made the templates and static directory and wrote the base_generic.html file using the example on the Django tutorial and our navbar code that we all used for our mockup UIs, making a few slight changes so that it fit our application as it is now (mostly removing the search bar since we have a browse function/page). I then copied the majority of my mockup UI code with only a few small changes since my page (profile.html) didnâ€™t require any fake data.
  
  Since my page was rather simple (at this stage in the project), I also edited views.py and urls.py, and then helped my teammates with their html files so that the fake data would display properly (mainly index.html and product.html). Chinh also helped me since her page is static and together we figured out how to link the home page to the products page.
