I contributed to several aspects of this project. One thing I did was getting images to show on all our pages. Edwood helped me with this in the beginning. I also fixed the navbar so that it’s even on all sides and added the logos and favicon. I edited and helped others with their css and html files so that images and the site’s “aesthetics” would should up correctly.

I contributed to init.py and models along with everyone else. I implemented the About page. I also started on linking pages together like having the “Match!” button on the home page link to the corresponding product page. Suzy and I finished this together. I also worked with Suzy to troubleshoot why data for the product page was not populating and we got it to work together.

Since we have to work with Git and command line, I was the point person for Git issues throughout the project. Whenever my peers had an issue with pushing or pulling, they came to me and I helped to resolve their issues. Additionally, I periodically shared resources that I knew would help my peers out. As a result, instead of relying on word of mouth, they had access to documentation, helpful examples, and etc. that could fix their error or issues.
