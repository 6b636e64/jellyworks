I contributed in multiple ways to this project. Early on in the project, I worked on the forms.py file. Eventually, I shifted to working on the views.py file and assisting other members of the group in any way that they needed. I also worked with my group members on conceptualizing the data model and how we needed to change it. 

My biggest contribution to the project was recording the video, keeping communication open, posting to the Slack, booking work spaces, and overall being flexible and open to trying to help with any problems that came up. I always tried to help troubleshoot and keep the group on task. 

While working on the final project, I want to be more involved in the actual coding rather than doing more of the surface level management and design. This would challenge me while also helping build my understanding of Django, especially as we move into trying to store images in our database.
